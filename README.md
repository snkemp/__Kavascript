Kava
====

Kava is a language specification that merges markup languages with conventional programming. It is designed to be easy to read and write as well as fast and efficient. Currently we have three projects:
* KTML: A program to be run that generates HTML, CSS, and JS from a .ktml file
* Kavascript: A javascript implementation that runs in the browser to alter an HTML DOM
* Kython: A python module that allows users to work with kava in a python environment
* Kava: A compiled language to be exclusively run in kava
